# Hi, I’m @boyhominid 
aka S. D. I'm an editor and translator broadly interested in cryptography as an index of compSci, as well as its possible ("if any") applications for digital humanities. Currently trying to become (more) proficient in Python and C; JS, and the markdown languages have been a part of my stack for a while, and thought it was about time I gave myself an upgrade... At the moment, I’m looking to collaborate on editorial and curatorial projects that bridge DH with "tech solutions," but I'm also interested in helping out anywhere I can gain practice. Pronouns are he/him, etc.
