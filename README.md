# Hi, I’m @boyhominid 
aka S. D. aka max Res. I'm an editor and translator with bylines in publications like <em>Dissent Magazine</em> and <em>Ars Technica</em>. I'm broadly interested in cryptography as an index of compSci. Currently taking baby-steps, learning Python and C; JS and the markdown languages have been a part of my stack for a while, and thought it was about time I gave myself an upgrade. At the moment, I’m looking to collaborate on editorial and curatorial projects that bridge digital humanities with "tech solutions." You can reach me on Twitter (also <a href="twitter.com/boyhominid">@boyhominid</a>). Pronouns are he/him.
